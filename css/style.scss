/*
well sir, take any website and go to screenfly, change devices u will see that
the text is either too small with respect to screen size, or the layouts that is 
card contaier are not scaling up, which wont be problem if used flex, grids, 
so try to know that, which way is the right way.
either setting layout first, or the elements init, like font size, and setting 
its container as min-content in grids
one way is to do layuout first, and using vh vw for text and elemnet
or media quries for font

another way is to best uptill now, setting each already responsive layout section's font size with respect to vw, and then using 
em, which will be respect to that font-size, to set up margin, padding within the container. or use vw vh for that too.
*/

//start with rem for padding,
// and for other length things- start with rem, look in all screen- try to adjust, if not use
// vw or max or clamp or min or minmax.
